# Chili58 Keyboard

Based on the [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58), this design uses choc spacing for all the keys. The PCB, baseplates, etc can be generated using [Ergogen](https://ergogen.cache.works/).

This design is a work in progress, and is by no means complete or even functional.

## Steps To Build

1. Paste yaml into https://ergogen.cache.works/ and generate PCB.
2. Open pcb file in KiCad, and route all connections
3. generate gerber files
4. upload to print PCB somewhere (?)
5. upload edge cuts to cut acrylic case somewhere (?)
